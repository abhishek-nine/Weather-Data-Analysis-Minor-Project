# Weather-Data-Analysis-Minor-Project
A Python-based system to analyze seasonal weather trends and detect outliers in Delhi.

# Weather Data Analysis & Visualization System 🌦️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Weather Data Analysis System** developed as a Minor Project for the 3rd Semester AI/ML course. It analyzes historical weather data from Delhi (2013-2017) to identify **seasonal trends** and uses statistical methods (Z-Score) to detect **extreme weather anomalies**.

## 🚀 Features
* **Data Cleaning (EDA):** Handling missing values, renaming columns, and formatting dates.
* **Trend Analysis:** Visualizing temperature changes over 4 years to demonstrate seasonality.
* **Outlier Detection:** Using **Z-Score analysis** to mathematically identify extreme weather events.
* **Visualization:** Detailed Line Plots and Box Plots using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy
* **Dataset:** Daily Climate Time Series Data (Delhi)

## 📊 How to Run
1.  Download the `.ipynb` file and the `.csv` file from this repository.
2.  Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
3.  Upload the CSV file to the runtime environment.
4.  Run all cells to see the analysis and graphs.

## 📈 Results
* **Seasonality:** The Line Plot clearly shows a sinusoidal wave pattern representing 4 annual summer-winter cycles.
* **Anomalies:** The Box Plot and Z-Score method confirm the distribution of temperature data and identify any statistical outliers.
